Once you've set your mind to become a proficient developer, your thirst for knowledge is bound to surge. However, one stumbling block you may encounter is dedicating excessive time trying to grasp every detail, particularly as a beginner, and you find yourself getting overwhelmed. At the same time, you realize you are investing a lot of time in courses, yet yielding minimal results. Can you relate to this scenario?

Note: This article is for developers.

### 1\. GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an autocompletion-style suggestion from an AI pair programmer as you code. This extension can suggest a full line of code for an entire project before writing it or suggest it as you write your code.

It is powered by OpenAI Codex to work in real time, right from your editor. As I said earlier, GitHub Copliot was created to :

* improve productivity
    
* foster better flow
    
* extend the time developers spend engaged in rewarding work.

From the picture above, The suggestions are displayed in grey colour. All the suggestions can be accepted at once using the **tab** button or the **ctrl** + **right-arrow** button to accept these suggestions bit by bit or ignore them. The majority of the programming languages work with GitHub Copilot including Python, Java, Javascript, CSS etc. [Read More](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilotvs&ssr=false#overview)

The sole drawback of this extension is that it cannot function without an internet connection on your device and you need to subscribe before you can use it.

### 2\. GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

GitHub Pull Request and Issues is an extension that helps you manage your pull request and issues instead of using the git command line.

It was created to make the deployment of code to GitHub easier without cracking your head with the prompt command. To use this extension, you must have a GitHub account and must have been linked to your visual code studio.

The icon marked in the above picture indicates the icon for GitHub Pull requests and issues. With just a click on that icon, the user can easily initialize a repository. [Read More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/get-started-github-and-visual-studio-code/)

### 3\. **Tabnine: AI Autocomplete & Chat**

Tabnine is an AI code assistant that makes you a better developer. Tabnine will increase your development velocity with real-time code completions, chat, and code generation in all the most popular coding languages and IDEs. This extension works almost the same as Github Copilot, the only difference between these two is that, TabNine can work both offline and online and you don't need to subscribe for it that is, It is free for all users.

The major drawback of this extension is that it does not work effectively like GitHub Copilot but let's hope it'll improve as time goes on and the suggestions are not displayed faster compared to GitHub Copilot.

### 4.GitHub Copliot Chat

GitHub Copilot Chat is a chat interface that lets you interact with GitHub Copilot, to ask and receive answers to coding-related questions from directly within a supported IDE instead of using your online forums to search for documentation or information.

GitHub Copilot Chat uses natural language processing and machine learning to understand your question and provide you with an answer. It can be used to quickly generate code snippets, explain code, debug code, and respond to code questions. [Read More](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/about-github-copilot-chat)

This extension also needs to be connected to the internet before it can be used. The sole drawback of this extension is that it can only assist with programming-related questions aside that nothing more.

### **5\. Tailwind CSS IntelliSense**
