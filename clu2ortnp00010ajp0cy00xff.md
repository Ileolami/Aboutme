## **INTRODUCTION**

   There is an adage that says, “study to show thyself approve”. To buttress the point, there is a saying that “we learn every day” Partially I don't agree with that because learning and improvement of skill most time must be birthed out of hunger for it. Let me take down to biblically scripture, remember when Bartimaeus the blind man from Jericho despite being shut up by people but still went on to cry out louder to Jesus for his healing and he received his healing well he could have just obeyed the people if he want to.

   Another scenario that amplifies my opinion is that the number of people who gained admission in year one depreciated when graduating successful students. One of the major challenges among students is that people don't have a thirst to learn or know better. 

    In this article, I will be sharing how my thirst for technical writing led me to the Technical Writing Mentorship Program, why I decided to join the mentorship program and where this program can be found.  

## **I FIND YOU** 

One beautiful morning, I woke up to the sound of birds singing at 8 am. To brighten my mood, I decided to scroll through Twitter. However, my good spirits were quickly dampened when I received a rejection email from a company where I had applied for a job as a Technical Writer. This was the fifth rejection I had received, and I couldn't help but feel discouraged.

Bola noticed my distress and asked, "What happened, ileolami?" With tears streaming down my face, I explained the situation. There was a moment of silence before Bola spoke up. "Ileolami," she said gently, "I know you're a good writer. You have a lot of potential to be a great technical writer. Have you considered equipping yourself with additional skills? Maybe you could watch some YouTube videos on technical writing or look into mentorship programs on Twitter. This way, you can identify the areas where you need to improve and work on them." It was then that I realized that I had never taken a mentorship program in technical writing, apart from the ones I had taken on software development.

       Days turn into weeks, and weeks become months. I made a decision to put my job applications on hold until I could find the right mentorship. I had already bought some books on technical writing to improve my knowledge and attended Twitter spaces related to technical writing. One night, while scrolling through Twitter as usual, I stumbled upon the Technical Writing Mentorship Program. The joy in my heart could be compared to that of a long-barren woman who had just given birth to twins. I quickly followed them and explored their pages, and to crown it all, I found out that they had a discord channel for their members. I joined immediately and got accepted. "This is a breakthrough!" I exclaimed in a loud voice.

## **WHY SHOULD I JOIN THE MENTORSHIP PROGRAM**
