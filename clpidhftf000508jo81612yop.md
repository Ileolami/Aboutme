## What is Web5???

%[https://media.giphy.com/media/jy0ZCCXxHrI7eEEGgn/giphy.gif] 

Web5 is a decentralized internet where users have complete control over their data. For instance, in June 2021, the Nigerian government banned its citizens from using Twitter, despite constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and the right to information. This is because they have control over our data and internet access. Web5 prevents such situations from occurring by giving users control over who can access their data and how it is stored.

It will not only give the users a platform to create decentralised apps and offer an unrestricted environment, but also the use of artificial intelligence is highly prominent in Web5 which users can interact with for asking questions and also use to explain a PDF document like the way Bling can summarize an entire current page to users.

Now you understand what Web5 is, let's move on to its components

## Components of Web5

Three major components of Web5 serve as the foundation on which Web5 is built based on [open standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard#:~:text=%22Open%20Standards%22%20are%20standards%20made,are%20intended%20for%20widespread%20adoption.), they are :

1. Decentralized Identifiers
    
2. Verifiable Credentials
    
3. Decentralized Web Nodes
    

### Decentralized Identifiers(DID)

Identifiers, as related to the internet, are the unique identities associated with us but major of these are controlled and owned by the government, organisations, companies etc e.g [https://github.com/ileolami](https://github.com/ileolami) is a domain name that led to my GitHub profile, but it is owned and controlled by Github, i.e Github own and has access to my data, they can disable or ban my identifier and I don't have the authority to stop that from happening.

A decentralized identifier is a unique identifier that is not controlled by any single entity, this means the user has control over their DIDs and can use it to interact with any online services anytime any day. It gives the users a decentralized identifier for decentralized applications which users can own and control without centralized entities. It also provides a standard structure that links to you and your information.

For example, you know when you want to sign up for any online services, we use our E-mail address which serves as our online identity without this email address sign-up will be difficult but in Web5, DIDs are used to replace this, i.e we don't have to rely on these centralized entities to gain access to these services. These DIDs are stored on the blockchain, ensuring that no single entity has control over your identity.

```json
did:example:1234567890#key-2
```

Decentralized identifiers contain three parts:

1. `did` - the URL scheme identifier.
    
    The URL scheme identifier is the first part of a URL and it specifies the protocol to be used to access the resource. Imagine you're standing at a T-junction, each path leading to various destinations. A URL scheme identifier acts like a signpost at that junction, indicating which path to take. It tells your browser or other applications the type of resource being requested and how to handle it.
    
2. `example:` - identifier for the DID method.
    
    A DID method is a specification that defines the format, structure, and operations for creating, resolving, updating, and deactivating DIDs.
    
3. `1234567890#key-1` - the DID method-specific identifier.
    

A DID method-specific identifier is a unique identifier that distinguishes a particular DID method from other methods. It serves as a label or prefix that identifies the method used to create and manage a specific DID. Think of DID method IDs as the different styles of passports that exist around the world. Each passport has a unique identification number, but the format and appearance of the passport itself may vary depending on the issuing country. Similarly, each DID has a unique identifier, but the format and structure of the DID may vary depending on the DID method used.

### Verifiable Credentials

imagine you want to apply for a Nigerian passport and you need to prove that you are a citizen of Nigeria. In the normal way, you will need to provide your NIN and other documents to validate that. Verifiable Credentials are digital certificates that contain claims about an individual or entity, such as their educational qualifications, work experience, age, or identity. These claims are cryptographically signed by the issuer, ensuring their authenticity and integrity. Think of VCs as a badge on your secondary school uniform or school ID card that shows you are a student of such a school. As a result of being kept on a distributed ledger or decentralized blockchain, these VCs are impervious to tampering and are difficult to change or counterfeit.

### Decentralized Web Nodes

Decentralized Web Nodes(DWNs) are computers or servers that store data, disseminate data and foster communication among users and applications in the Web5 ecosystem, this includes all devices that have access to the internet e.g. mobile phones, laptops etc. DWNs are globally distributed ensuring the control is not in the hands of a single entity. You can liken a DWN to a bulletin board in a student hostel where students can post any ads or activities. DWNs function through data storage, data sharing, data verification and data support.

## Use Cases

You may be wondering what kind of projects can be accomplished with Web5,

%[https://media.giphy.com/media/35SxseaXSYiOI9NhH5/giphy.gif] 

here are some cases that can be carried out with Web5 :

### HealthCare Data Management

Storing patients' medical records in traditional ways has some limitations when it comes to accessibility after a long period. For instance, let's consider the case of Mr. Alex who was diagnosed with lung disease ten years ago at St. Louis Catholic Hospital. Unfortunately, his medical record cannot be found because it was kept in a book and the hospital had to burn some records to make space for other patients. As a result, Mr Alex will have to go through the registration process again, answer questions, and undergo another diagnosis for the same illness he was previously treated for. This leads to double spending, waste of time, and unnecessary stress.

Web5 offers a decentralized blockchain solution for storing patient data. With the help of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), patients can choose who can access their medical information, giving them the power to make informed decisions. DIDs also facilitate secure and standardized data exchange among healthcare providers, which can lead to a comprehensive view of a patient's medical history. Furthermore, DIDs enable secure and transparent data access for researchers, promoting data-driven research and innovation in the healthcare industry.

### **Identity Management and Verification**

Alexia needs to verify her identity as a citizen of Nigeria to apply for an international passport. However, she is unable to do so at the moment due to the unavailability of the NIN website. She is faced with two options: either wait for three days to verify her identity or travel to the state capital to obtain her NIN details.

In such a scenario, Web5 technologies, such as verifiable credentials (VCs), can offer a secure and reliable mechanism for issuing, storing, and verifying identity credentials. This empowers individuals to create and manage their own digital identities, providing them with control over their data and how it is used, without depending on any centralized identity system. By leveraging Web5, onboarding and verification processes for various services can be streamlined, reducing the need for repetitive paperwork and manual verification.

### **Education and Learning**

Segun is a 15-year-old boy who lives in a village located far from the city. Due to the limited access to educational resources in his village, he faces challenges in pursuing his dream of studying Civil Engineering. However, with the help of Web5, Segun can access decentralized learning platforms that offer interactive building and structural tutorials, online courses, and mentorship opportunities from experienced engineers around the world. By connecting with peers from different backgrounds, Segun can collaborate on building projects, enhancing his learning experience. Web5 also facilitates lifelong learning and skill development by providing access to on-demand courses, training materials, and personalized learning pathways. Additionally, Web5 technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) can create immersive and engaging learning experiences, enhancing motivation and knowledge retention.
