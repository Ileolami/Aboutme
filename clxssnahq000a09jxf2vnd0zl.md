## Problem Story

### Unbothered

"Up Nepa," "Go and charge my phone," These are the announcements echoing from one house to another. People began rushing back to their homes. "Iya Taiwo, please let me charge my phone; I'll come back for my pepper," my neighbour said.

As for me, I wasn't bothered because my phone and power bank were fully charged. You may be wondering why people are rushing home to charge their gadgets. Here is the story.

### The Total Blackout

One day, my mom called to tell me that our transformer cable had been stolen. "What! This can't be happening now," I responded with sadness. "What are we going to do? This is so unfair." "Let's just trust God to touch their hearts so they can fix this issue quickly," she said. "Mom, you know this issue will last for over a year," I replied. "What are we going to do then? Well, I've gotten an inverter for us at least, so the whole building won't be in darkness," she announced. "That's better. I will call you later, Mom." "Okay, my daughter."

We ended the call, but my mood changed for the rest of the day because I predicted the issue would last for over a year. The joy of coming home disappeared. The thought of charging my gadgets clouded my mind all day. "The little power we had is now completely gone," I thought aloud. Before the total blackout, we had a daily 5-hour power outage, which wasn't even consistent.

### Promise and Fail: Adaptation by Force

Days turned into weeks, weeks into months, and months into years. My area spent a total of one year and nine months in complete blackout. During this time, the chairman held several meetings with the power supply agency. Each household was asked to contribute five thousand naira, but it was all in vain. A politician even used the issue for his campaign, promising to fix it if elected. He got the votes but did nothing.

There is a saying that "Nigerians adapt to things easily." Yes, we do. Soon, people started finding alternatives. Some opted for solar power, Some lived on generators others bought power banks. It was common to see households with 3-5 power banks, charging them at work or paying to have them charged. Charging a power bank costs three hundred nairas, an Android phone costs one hundred and fifty nairas, and iPhones for two hundred nairas.

"The power will go off now," I predicted. As expected, the power was seized within two minutes. Guess what? The power was fully restored after two weeks. It was both funny and not funny at the same time. Now, my area rarely has more than five hours of power outage daily, but sometimes we experience total blackouts for days or even weeks.

You might be wondering if this issue is unique to my area or if it's a general problem in Nigeria. What is the current state of energy in Nigeria? Can electric vehicles be adopted in such conditions? What is the solution to this? This article will answer all these questions using survey research and results.

## State of Energy in Nigeria

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/11022/energy-sector-in-nigeria/#topicOverview) report as shown below:

![Statias report](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1718911111166/c8bec498-e10b-49a3-b8cb-502b18ad13b4.png align="center")

A large share of Nigerian citizens remains refrained from access to electricity. In 2020, just over 55 percent of Nigerians had access to electricity, leaving 45 percent of the inhabitants in the dark.

You may be wondering what exactly is the major cause of this shortage, is it a lack of resources including finances? Before we analyze the current state of energy in Nigeria, let's have a brief look into some of the sources of energy in Nigeria

Nigeria's energy sources are diverse, encompassing both traditional fossil fuels and renewable energy. The country has substantial natural gas reserves, which are a significant source of electricity generation, and it heavily relies on oil, being one of Africa's largest producers. Hydropower is a key renewable energy source, with large plants like the Kainji and Jebba dams contributing to the national grid. Solar energy is increasingly adopted, especially in rural and off-grid areas, through initiatives like the Nigeria Electrification Project. Coal, though less prominent, is still used for electricity generation, and bioenergy from agricultural waste and other organic materials also forms part of Nigeria's energy mix.

It is right to say that Nigeria is one of the countries richly blessed with natural resources. To know how blessed the nation is, Nigeria has the largest natural gas reserves in Africa and is the continent's leading oil producer. Not only that, the country has significant coal reserves, abundant solar energy potential, and vast hydropower resources, making it a powerhouse of diverse energy sources.

The lack of a reliable power supply in a country with so many resources remains a mystery to me. Countries with few or no natural energy sources still ensure their citizens enjoy a 24-hour power supply. Currently, most the people rely on Generators and solar power, especially business owners funniest thing even Electricity Distribution Companies also rely on Generators or solar power for day-to-day activities

## State of EVs in Nigeria

![Vice President Yemi Osinbajo test drives the Kona Electric](https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2021/06/Vice-President-Yemi-Osinbajo-test-drives-the-Kona-Electric.jpg?resize=900%2C570&ssl=1 align="left")

Electric Vehicles (EVs) are vehicles that are powered by electric motors using energy stored in rechargeable batteries or another energy storage device. Given the current state of electricity in Nigeria, it's clear that the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is still primitive. This is evident to both citizens and non-citizens.

According to [Energy for Growth](https://energyforgrowth.org/article/accelerating-electric-mobility-in-nigeria/), Nigeria is making progress with EVs. In June 2021, the Vice President unveiled the first made-in-Nigeria EV, the Hyundai Kona by Stallion Motors. The country also opened its first EV charging station at Usmanu Danfodiyo University in Sokoto State. EVs in Nigeria could support renewable energy, lower emissions, reduce energy investments, and eliminate the need for petroleum subsidies. However, challenges remain.

Let me share a funny incident that happened in the city of Lagos. A popular crypto trader bought a Tesla, and the news spread quickly on social media. He received many congratulatory messages from his friends and followers. Two weeks later, while driving, his car suddenly broke down on the road. People suggested he get fuel from a nearby gas station, not realizing it was an electric vehicle. He was stranded because there were no charging stations available. How he managed to move the vehicle remains a mystery.

The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in Nigeria faces several significant challenges, including high costs, lack of infrastructure and technical know-how, electricity access and reliability gaps, and political entrenchment of oil and gas. The cost of EVs is substantially higher than engine vehicles (ICEVs), with the average cost of a new EV around $55,600 (₦23 million), far above the mean annual ₦2 million salary in Lagos.

Public EV charging infrastructure is almost nonexistent, and Nigerian roadside mechanics, typically informally trained in fixing ICEVs, lack knowledge of EV maintenance. Nigeria has the world's largest energy access gap, with over 85 million people lacking grid electricity, and those with access often experience unreliable supply, making it difficult to prioritize electricity for EVs over essential services.

## State of Rechargeable Devices in Nigeria

![Media generated by meta.ai](https://z-p3-scontent.flos1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/o1/v/t0/f1/m253/upload_img_py_pred_06_22_2024_04_00_39_4440409319182736865.jpeg?_nc_ht=z-p3-scontent.flos1-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&ccb=9-4&oh=00_AYDHl3mcCAZdn9jR24YfJuibx7cdwnyibylxLFh4IEJZjQ&oe=66789314&_nc_sid=5b3566 align="left")

What are rechargeable devices? Rechargeable devices are electronic gadgets that can be powered up and used multiple times by recharging their internal batteries. These devices typically use rechargeable batteries, such as lithium-ion, nickel-metal hydride (NiMH), or nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries. They can be recharged using an external power source like a wall outlet, USB port, or solar panel.

The demand for rechargeable devices in Nigeria has created a profitable market, with various brands and models available to meet different needs and budgets. We have seen a variety of rechargeable devices beyond mobile phones, laptops, and power banks, including rechargeable lamps, standing fans, handheld fans often used at events, rechargeable blenders, and even rechargeable freezers.

While these products are impressive, the high demand highlights the lack of reliable electricity in the country. To emphasize the importance of these devices, when purchasing phones, laptops, or power banks, people tend to choose those with long-lasting batteries that can sustain them for hours or days. It's common to see people owning two to three power banks or phones with 5,000-7,000mAh batteries, depending on their usage.

Despite buying these devices, keeping them powered is still a challenge. In Nigeria, it's common for local government areas to be in total darkness for years due to unreliable power supply. As a result, people often face damage or theft while searching for places to charge their devices or using unreliable sources that end up damaging their phones.

## Decharge: The Solution Provider

Now that you have recognised the challenge, Are the government doing anything to fix this issue?

A recent report from [Worldbank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2023/12/15/nigeria-to-expand-access-to-clean-energy-for-17-5-million-people#:~:text=Other%20development%20partners%20collaborating%20on%20the%20program,with%20new%20or%20improved%20access%20to%20electricity) stated that the World Bank approved the Nigeria Distributed Access through Renewable Energy Scale-up (DARES) project, funded by a $750 million IDA credit. This project will attract over $1 billion in private capital and additional financing from various development partners. The goal is to provide over 17.5 million Nigerians with new or improved electricity access through distributed renewable energy solutions, using innovative financing to boost private sector-led clean electricity in Nigeria.

Despite all these efforts, the challenge remains the same. So, the question now is: while waiting for the government to fix this issue, what is the best alternative solution, especially for those who can't afford a generator or solar power?

## Discussion of Findings

**State of Electricity** survey results show significant dissatisfaction with Nigeria's electricity supply. Nearly half (42.9%) are unhappy with the availability of electricity, and only 7.1% are very satisfied. While most (71.4%) rarely face power outages, 28.6% experience them a few times a month. 42.9% have daily outages lasting 6 to 10 hours, and 21.4% face outages over 10 hours. These findings highlight the poor state of electricity in Nigeria and the urgent need for infrastructure improvements.

**State of Evs** survey results indicate a notable interest in purchasing electric vehicles (EVs) among Nigerians, with 42.9% of respondents somewhat interested and 28.6% very interested. However, the biggest barriers to wider adoption are the high cost of EVs, lack of charging stations, and limited range, as agreed by 71.4% of respondents. Despite the interest, the unreliable power supply in Nigeria poses a significant challenge to EV adoption, making it difficult for potential buyers to commit to purchasing EVs.

**State of Rechargeable Devices** survey results show that 85.7% of Nigerians often struggle to keep their rechargeable devices powered. Most respondents believe that solutions for storing electrical energy would be very beneficial for mass use in Nigeria. This highlights the impact of unreliable electricity on daily life and the urgent need for better power solutions to support the demand for rechargeable devices.

**Market strategy** survey reveals a strong interest in a convenient and accessible device charging solution, with 92.9% of respondents interested. Furthermore, 78.6% are likely to use such a service in the future. Transparent and affordable charging costs are important to 78.6% of respondents, and 64.3% prefer multiple payment options, including cash, bank transfer, and cryptocurrency. This indicates a high demand for a versatile, user-friendly charging network with flexible payment methods and clear pricing.

## Proposed Market Strategy

Before any product comes into existence, it is ideal for the team to conduct research to:

1. Identify the specific problems the target audience is facing
    
2. Understand the needs of the users
    
3. Learn the approaches others are using to reach the target audience
    
4. Recognize what others are not doing
    

**IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS THE TARGET AUDIENCE IS FACING**

At this point, you can tell the specific problem the Nigerians are facing is unreliable power supply. The majority of the people are not satisfied with the state of electricity leaving them to sort out alternatives such as solar power or generators. Even with these alternatives, the cost of purchasing or maintaining them is higher for an average Nigerian.

**UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THE USERS**

The need for Nigerians is a reliable power supply for both rechargeable devices and EVs. Unfortunately, only the government can provide this for its citizens. Despite this, an alternative like ReCHRG that gives citizens access to power for basic needs like rechargeable devices and eventually electric vehicles is essential, as research shows people are interested in EVs.

**LEARN THE APPROACH OTHERS ARE USING TO REACH THE TARGET AUDIENCE**

Most of the approaches other brands are using include:

1. Having a representative in each local government area.
    
2. Educating people about their products through events, tours, and in commercial areas like marketplaces.
    
3. Advertisements on various television and radio stations, as well as social media ads.
    
4. Gathering customer feedback.
    

**RECOGNISE WHAT OTHERS ARE NOT DOING**

Most of these brands only offer short-term solutions. For example, power banks provide energy storage that can last for days, but are they offering ways to recharge these devices? The answer is NO. They only focus on batteries with higher mAh, but some of these products are not durable. Currently, a power bank model that used to be the best is now losing its market value due to its lack of durability.

### Call to Action

With this understanding, I'm sure you are already thinking of strategies, right? Let's dive in.

**EDUCATION**

DeCharge is a web3-based project, not a regular one, and the problems Nigerians face are not unique to just the elite or educated people but affect both educated and uneducated individuals. As it aims to solve this problem, it is important to note that people only purchase products that bring value and that they understand well.

Each product should be communicated in simple and comprehensive terms, including payment protocol and those offering their infrastructure. Everything about this product should be made clear to the people. This process will easily captivate people's minds, including older individuals. For example, the famous "TAP" process of farming airdrop indirectly onboard people into the web3 space.

**ADVERTISING**

The best marketing happens when the product is on everyone's lips and ears. DeCharge Products should be advertised on all social media platforms, and television stations, including local TV stations, and radio stations.

Also, leveraging influencers and community leaders to spread the word can amplify the reach. Engaging in community events and offering demonstrations can also help in building trust and awareness among potential users.

**SOLAR POWER COMPATIBILITY**

The issue is the unreliable power supply, right? DeCharge should make ReCHRG and other products compatible with solar power. This way, people who can't afford traditional power sources can still use these products for commercial purposes.

This compatibility would ensure that even in areas with frequent power outages, users can still rely on solar energy to keep their devices and vehicles charged. By integrating solar power options, Decharge can provide a more sustainable and accessible solution, helping to bridge the energy gap and support the needs of a broader audience.

**ACCESSIBILITY**

When I asked the people this question during the survey: **How do you want this charging station to look like?**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719169800158/1d2d71f1-56e1-4714-96a3-a477912b8520.png align="center")

It is important to make these charging stations accessible to everyone nationwide. This is similar to how some brands captured the market quickly. For example, Oraimo power banks are easy to purchase; you don't have to go far to get one as they are sold everywhere, even by street vendors. Decharge can follow this approach and ensure that there is at least one charging station on every street in Nigeria and ReCHRG can be easily purchased.

**PAYMENT OPTION**

It is great to see that payment can be made through cryptocurrency. However, with the current government stance against crypto, payment for this service should be available in various options such as cash and bank transfers. Remember, most respondents prefer multiple payment options.

Also, the charges for this service, ReCHRG and other products should be affordable for everyone, comparable to the cost of solar power, generators, and power banks. (People compare)

**CHARGING STATIONS**

Have you ever visited a car wash? Many car washes now have a minibar or a relaxation space for games and other activities. This means that while you wait for your car to be washed, you can enjoy some activities, eat, or drink. The income comes from both washing services and relaxation services.

This approach can also be adopted for charging stations. People won't just come to charge their devices or vehicles; other services can be included, such as a workspace.

Here are some suggestions from respondents:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719170965959/fdbf4d80-9cba-45b2-b166-8d935f09216a.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719171024867/f79f351f-9ff8-41f5-964c-4312967630d7.png align="center")

These other services call attention to others to patronize these facilities.

**SECURITY**

Inasmuch Decharge is offering transparency using the blockchain. Decharge should partner with the charging station owners to ensure maximum security for devices, vehicles and people who will be using this service.

Most charging stations use protocols like identification methods or number tags for devices given to their owners when they come to charge or collect their devices.

**PARTNERSHIP**

Decharge should collaborate with solar power manufacturers to provide reliable and sustainable energy for their products. This partnership would integrate solar power into charging stations and devices, enhancing functionality and promoting renewable energy. Although initial costs are high, long-term benefits include lower bills and environmental sustainability. Partnering with solar power manufacturers can help Decharge offer cost-effective and sustainable energy solutions.
