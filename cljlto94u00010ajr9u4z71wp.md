### **Introduction**

Have you ever wondered what makes Web3 special and outstanding? Decentralization is what distinguishes Web3 from Web2. This article will give you an overview of why decentralization makes Web3 better.

### MEANING OF DECENTRALIZATION

Remember when the Nigerian government bans Twitter for some months? Yes, the citizens were banned from Twitter. They could do that because Twitter was centralized meaning authority was centred on one hand. So Twitter and any other social media platforms can decide to lock their users out. These platforms have policies and regulations and if violated by any users can lead to a blocked account.

Decentralization refers to the architectural and organizational principle of distributing control and authority away from a central entity or authority. This simply means authority and control are not in the hands of one person or organization. It is a basic idea in the creation of the subsequent internet generation, where blockchain technology is crucial. Peer-to-peer protocols, consensus methods, and blockchain networks are used in Web3 to accomplish decentralization.

### ROLES OF DECENTRALIZATION IN WEB3

* **Increased Security**: Since decentralized systems disperse data around numerous nodes or computers, they are safer than centralized ones. Data is kept over a network of computers in Web3, where blockchain technology is frequently used, making it more secure against hacking and data breaches. This improves the applications' security and integrity as well as the data stored in them. For example, distributed ledger like Google sheet.
    
* **Elimination of Failure**: A single point of failure in centralized systems can cause problems throughout the entire system. For example, the crash of Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook kept users lockout for hours to a technical issue within the infrastructure of these platforms. By eliminating single points of failure, decentralization reduces this risk. Web3 reduces downtime and increases overall dependability by distributing data and applications across a network of nodes, ensuring that the system continues to function even if one node fails.
    
* **Enhanced Data Privacy**: Large volumes of user data are often collected and stored by centralized systems, making them susceptible to misuse or security breaches. By utilizing encryption and user-owned digital identities, decentralized applications (dApps) in Web3 provide users with more control over their data. By allowing users to decide what information to share and with whom, users can enhance data privacy and lower the dangers of centralizing data storage.
    
* **Democratized Access:** Decentralisation encourages involvement and access for all. In centralized systems, a central authority may impose restrictions on or exercise control over access to particular services or platforms. Anyone with an internet connection can engage, do business, and communicate with decentralized applications on Web3. This promotes inclusivity, lowers entrance barriers, and gives people more power.
    
* **Community Governance**: Decentralised governance, in which decisions are made collectively by the community of participants, is a concept introduced in Web3. Users can now participate in the design and direction of the programs they use, replacing the top-down decision-making of centralized systems. Decentralized governance models aim for openness, diversity, and decision-making by consensus.
    

### CONCLUSION

Web3's decentralized architecture intends to democratize the internet by granting users more control over their data, promoting trust, and facilitating peer-to-peer interactions. It increases user agency, lessens dependency on centralized authorities, and fosters accountability, security, and privacy.
