## Introduction

A long time ago, communication was not as strong as it is now. it takes a lot of time before it gets to the receiver, at times it may warrant either the sender to travel down to see the receiver to deliver the message while it may take time before the message gets to the receiver. This is similar to one of the challenges blockchain technology was facing, Transferring assets or data between different blockchain networks was time-consuming and often required complex manual processes. For example, if a user wanted to transfer a cryptocurrency token from one blockchain to another, they often had to go through lengthy and cumbersome procedures, akin to the sender having to travel to deliver a message in person.

How can this problem be solved? With the advent of interoperability protocols and cross-chain solutions, blockchain communication evolved seamlessly, just like the way our modern communication technologies make it easy to message instantly and globally.

With innovation, comes [**WORMHOLE**](https://wormhole.com/) an interoperability protocol that allows developers to build cross-chain applications effortlessly. In this article, we will explore what Wormhole is, its importance, features, supported blockchain, programming languages, Wormhole SDKs and their uses, quick tutorials, and proposed product ideas.

## Why Wormhole

In this phase, we will be diving into what Wormhole is and its importance to product development as a Developer. As earlier said Wormhole is an interoperability protocol, designed to facilitate communication and transfer of digital assets between multiple blockchains. It serves as a "bridge" that enables different blockchain networks like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Terra, Solana, Polygon, Avalanche, and Oasis to interact with each other. With Wormhole, developers can write a single smart contract for their Decentralized Applications (DApps) which interact seamlessly with multiple blockchain networks.

The good thing about Wormhole is that it is developer-friendly, i.e. it is easy to integrate with and offers security. It enables developers to deploy their smart contracts on multiple chains, synchronize data across chains, and transfer assets easily between chains. Wormhole also supports cross-chain communication, allowing applications to interact with each other across different chains. This protocol can save time and reduce the risk of errors when dealing with complex code.

A pictorial diagram demonstrating how a wormhole works is presented by [Wormhole](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole). ðŸ‘‡

From this diagram above, this is an illustration that shows the communication between two chains. The source Chain is the sender while the target chain is the receiver.

Some [Multi-chain apps](https://wormhole.com/multichain-apps/) built with Wormhole are [Allbridge](https://core.allbridge.io/), [C3](https://c3.io/), [Carrier](https://www.carrier.so/), [Hashflow](https://app.hashflow.com/), [Synonym](https://www.synonym.finance/), [Portal](https://portalbridge.com/) e.t.c

### Features of Wormhole

It is important to note some of the features of wormhole, they are :

1. [**Access to Multiple Blockchains**](https://wormhole.com/blockchains/): Developers can now access liquidity and users on over 20 leading blockchain networks via Wormhole. This enables use cases across DeFi, NFTs, governance and other areas, and allows developers to take advantage of multiple ecosystems for their applications.
    
2. **Cross-Chain Messaging Protocol**: Wormhole is a protocol that allows communication between blockchains and enables developers to send arbitrary data cross-chain, including tokens, NFTs, oracle data, governance decisions, and more.

## Wormhole SDKs

What is SDK? SDK stands for **Software Development Kit.** It's a collection of software tools and libraries that developers use to create applications for specific platforms. An SDK provides a set of tools, libraries, relevant documentation, code samples, processes, and guides that developers can use and integrate into their apps. some of Wormhole SDKS include:

1. [**Conne**](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/reference/sdk-docs/connect-sdk)[**ct**](https://go.dev/?ref=wormhole.ghost.io)[**SDK**:](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/reference/sdk-docs/connect-sdk) This is a TypeScript SDK for interacting with the chains Wormhole supports and the protocols built on top of Wormhole. It's a work in progress. It can be used to get a ChainContext object for a specific chain, fetch balances, get a TokenBridge client for `srcChain`, and grab a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) client. For example, you can use it to create an app that showcases users' balances, just by inputting their wallet address.
    
2. [**Wormhole Solidity SDK**:](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/quick-start/tutorials/hello-token#wormhole-solidity-sdk) This SDK helps developers make cross-chain development with Wormhole easier. It specifically provides the TokenSender and TokenReceiver abstract classes with useful functionality for sending and receiving tokens using TokenBridge. This can also be used to write smart contracts for validating transactions across multi-chain platforms.
